# `pathfinder2_geometry_v`
A port of the `pathfinder2-geometry` module from my robotics library,
[Pathfinder2](https://github.com/Wobblyyyy/Pathfinder2). This is still a
work-in-progress and there will be some differences between the original
Pathfinder2 code and this code, but, for the most part, this repository aims
to replicate the functionality of `pathfinder2-geometry`.

This is a shared library, meaning there's so executable here. To compile the
library, type the following command in this repo's root directory.
```bash
v -shared -prod .
```
